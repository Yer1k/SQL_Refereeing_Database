Hi all,

Piror to MIDS program, I have been climbing referee rank ladder in China from 2019 to 2022 (2018 in the U.S., yes, I am USSF referee as well).

The highest profile game I have officied is the pre-season clash between two Chinese Super League (TOP 1 professional soccer league in China), Chengdu Rongcheng FC vs Henan Songshan Longmen FC

This project is focuing on creating SQLite3 database via codespaces by using the data I have collected by my own through out the years. Then try to gain insights from .db database using SQL queries.
