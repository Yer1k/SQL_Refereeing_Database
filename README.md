Piror to MIDS program at Duke, I have been climbing referee rank ladder in China from 2019 to 2022 (2018 in the U.S., yes, I am USSF referee as well).

The highest profile game I have officied is the pre-season clash between two Chinese Super League (TOP 1 professional soccer league in China), Chengdu Rongcheng FC vs Henan Songshan Longmen FC on April 29, 2022

This project is focuing on creating SQLite3 database via codespaces by using the data I have collected by my own through out the years. Then try to gain insights from .db database using SQL queries.
